                Belated Happy Valentine's Day 💘 
                <br><br>
                I know Valentine’s Day already passed, but I didn’t want the day to go by without telling you something I’ve been meaning to say.
                <br><br>
                I always thank God for having someone like you in my life, Karyl. A lot of realizations and learnings I gained because of you.
                <br><br>
                Confessing to someone you like is not easy. I had a lot of overthinking first before I gathered myself to confess my feelings
                <br><br>
                to you. You might have felt weird, wondering how I could like someone I barely talked to before? But like what I told you before,
                <br><br>
                feelings are inevitable. You don't really choose who you fall for, sometimes it just happens unexpectedly. Of course, it did hurt
                <br><br>
                when you told me you love me as a friend. But at the same time, I truly appreciate your honesty. You respected me enough to be 
                <br><br>
                clear about your feelings. That means a lot to me. I understand that not everything we feel will always be returned the same way, 
                <br><br>
                and that’s okay, my love 😊. What matters to me is that I was honest about how I feel. I don’t regret telling you, because at 
                <br><br>
                least now my heart is clear. No matter what, I’m still grateful that you’re part of my life. You’ve helped me grow in ways you 
                <br><br>
                probably don’t even realize. And even if my feelings were not the same as yours, I will always respect you and wish you genuine 
                <br><br>
                happiness. I want you to know that I'm always here whenever you need someone to talk to, yung makakapag-rant ka about what 
                <br><br>
                happened about your day without worrying about being judged. And please take care always. I know na lagi ko itong sinasabi sa'yo,
                <br><br>
                but it's just that you really matter to me. So please always take care. I'll end my message here, bebi. Good luck with all the 
                <br><br>
                goals you want to achieve in life. I'll always be your No. 1 supporter. I love you, Karyl. 💖
